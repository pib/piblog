* TODO Iniital implementation
  - [5/7] Blog Flask app and script
    - [X] Script which runs app
    - [X] Takes argument for flask config
    - [X] Sets up instance folder based on config location
    - [X] Sets up Flask-FlatPages
    - [-] Sets up Frozen-Flask
      - [X] Get themes generated into frozen site
      - [ ] Use theme.return_bundle to freeze packed assets. Perhaps
            have an option to not bundle JS and/or CSS. When bundling,
            though, the non-bundled CSS and JS should not be copied
            into the output during a freeze.
      - [ ] Output files to a different location by default (next to
            piblog.cfg?)
      - [ ] Allow users to specify their own path(s) for themes,
            document how to do so.
      - [ ] Implement bundling of .scss files into css
    - [X] Uses Flask-Fleem to render pages
    - [ ] Uses Flask-Assets to compile static assets
  - [0/3] Enhancement
    - [ ] Get Pygments set up and working properly
    - [ ] Allow users to switch between themes (static files only, not
          templates) Via javascript and/or cookies.
    - [ ] Documentation for all features.
* TODO Documentation
  - [0/3] Configuration Documentation
    - [ ] How to specify which theme is used
    - [ ] How to specify where to look for themes
    - [ ] How to specify whether JS/CSS files are bundled (they are
          bundled by default)
  - [0/4] Theme Documentation
    - [ ] Required directories and files
    - [ ] Which files and extensions are handled specially (.js and
          .css are bundled together into the output by default, .scss
          files are converted to .css and bundled with the other .css)
    - [ ] What order are bundles converted (I'm not sure myself, but
          hopefully it's something like lexicographical order so order
          can be specified by adding numbers to the beginning)
    - [ ] What files are skipped (files starting with "_", for
          example, to allow .scss files to include others without them
          just being bundled into the whole thing)
  - [0/3] Page/Post Documentation
    - [ ] Required fields for .md file headers.
    - [ ] How to use pygments syntax highlighting.
    - [ ] How to write posts/pages in languages other than markdown
          (if/when implemented)
